If you happen to both be a sports fan and slightly too addicted to youtube, you might have come across the term Scorigami - a concept invented by [Jon Bois](https://bsky.app/profile/jonbois.bsky.social) to denote [**"the act, and art, of producing a final score in a football game that has never happened before"**](https://www.sbnation.com/2014/9/8/6110147/pete-carroll-seahawks-scoragami-weird-nfl-scores). These scorigamis were originally just funny statistical oddities, but after [Secret Base's viral video essay on scorigamis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l5C8cGMueY), these unique scoring events have gained a life of their own:

Nowadays it's a massive deal when a scorigami happens in an american football game[^1], to the point it might even be [mentioned on the official NFL broadcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16VXdbigeqM)!

[^1]: Ok I might be slightly exagerating, but don't let facts get in the way of a good story!
