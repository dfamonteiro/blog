## The Missing README (Chris Riccomini & Dmitriy Ryaboy)

- It was recommended this book by a work colleague and I have to say that for junior engineers. Is a must read. Unfortunately in my case. I was already. Here and a couple of months into my current job, so it wasn't very didn't make any sense for me.

## The Manager's Path (Camille Fournier)

- Look after reading the missing read me was. Was an interesting experience and natural. A natural continuation to the missing red. It was interesting. Take. Being my mindful of types of problems and the kind of work that managers. Have to do? But as expected, I felt that the first few chapters were very. Very interesting and useful, but to other ones when when it comes to managing multiple teams or being a CTO. Where otherwise engaging in the realm of politics, and it wasn't very useful.

## Designing Data-Intensive Applications (Martin Kleppmann)

- IMO, borderline mandatory reading for any software engineer
  - uni spends a lot of time teaching SQL and database normalization (which is completely fine), but when you start working professionally as a software engineer, you acquire a whole other set of practical working knowledge out when working with databases and the great thing about this book is that it gives you a knowledge and understading of databases and data systems that you take 5 to 10 years to acquire organically in a normal working environment.

- My favorite chapter was. And the chapter about the transaction installations. It was very useful. To back my work knowledge with the very extensive explanations that were present in this book.

- Funny: all the talk about consensus... and then the problem is outsourced to zookeper

- All the time spent talking about traditional DBs... and then the book aggressively pivots towards using durable message queues with idempotent message processing, which is fine and a great idea but I don't think that enough time was spent the practicalities of building an architecture around the idea of having events as the "source of truth" and the traditional database almost as a state machine.

## Artemis (Andy Weir)

- We wasn't able to finish reading this book because I was starting getting depressed with reading the seeing the main character through life throw away air life. However, I would like to explain on some topics that. I found very interesting the book, more specifically the word building. I found extremely interesting to start at the author put into the technical considerations of having an habitat on the moon and all the safety and security protocols that they have, specially around the airlocks And preventing a sudden depressurization events.

- Another interesting aspect of this book is how the harsh conditions of the habitats. Went to a formation of a mini society. Inside it. With several strata.

## Project Hail Mary (Andy Weir)

## Semiconductor Manufacturing Technology (Michael Quirk & Julian Serda)

- I think that for anyone with a passing interest in semiconductor manufacturing technologyAnd technical mindset. I would recommend that they should read this book. I'm well aware that this is a text, a university level textbook. But I found it very very readable. And gives you a somewhat complete knowledge of the semiconductor manufacturing process Wish wish you would, you wouldn't be able to get. Just from reading books and. And listening to Youtube videos.
