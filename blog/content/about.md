I'm a third year software engineering student at [FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL "FEUP's webpage")
(Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto).

I am currently interested in multithreaded programming, rocket control, orbital dynamics and in analysing mega constellations as distributed systems. As a fan of [Formula 1](https://www.f1.com/, "Formula 1's homepage") and [Formula E](https://www.fiaformulae.com/ "Formula E's homepage"), I enjoy analysing certain aspects of those championships and imagining what the future of motorsport will look like, on a technical level.

In my spare time, besides writing code, I enjoy playing games such as [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/ "Kerbal Space Program's home page"), 
[Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/ "Factorio's homepage") and blundering queens in chess. I'm also a mediocre trumpet player.

Feel free to reach out to me at daniel.amaro.monteiro@gmail.com or at [@dfamonteiro](https://twitter.com/dfamonteiro "My twitter profile") on twitter.
I am always happy to answer questions regarding my blog posts, projects and employment/internship opportunities.
