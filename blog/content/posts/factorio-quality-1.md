## Prologue

Video games have this incredible ability to evoque certain feelings and states of mind on the people that play them. You can experience pretty much every emotion, starting from happiness, amazement, and wonder going all the way to sadness, frustation, and heartbreak. Games can make you laugh and cry, they can make you focus, and sometimes they make you _think_.

Factorio is a game that makes you think. It gives such fascinating production and logistics challenges to its players that sometimes they stop playing and write [research papers](https://scholar.google.pt/scholar?hl=en&q=factorio "Factorio research") about the problems they face in this game[^1]. In the recently released Factorio [Space Age](https://www.factorio.com/space-age/content "Space Age web page") expansion, a new feature was added that allows the player to gamble their way into having better versions of every item in the game: Quality.

[^1]: I'm particularly fond of effort and research that has gone into [belt balancers](https://tuprints.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/17621/8/thesis.pdf).
