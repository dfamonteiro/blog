The 2021 Monaco E-Prix was the first time that Formula E hosted a race in this historical venue with the full track layout. When it comes to historical races, the Monaco Grand Prix is definitely an odd one. Older than Formula 1 itself, it is F1's most glamorous and most prestigious race on the calendar, featuring a track layout that remains largely unchanged[^1] since the race's inception in 1929. Unfortunately, when it comes to on-track action, it is an absolutely dreadful race, with cars that are impossible to race on this track[^2]. So, when Formula E announced that the full track layout would be used, people were hopeful that we see _a genuine overtake_ in Monaco.

It was not only a moment of vindication for António Félix da Costa, but also for Formula E and more importantly, the Monaco Grand Prix track itself.

[^1]: There _have_ been some track changes, including a couple made to prevent [drivers from accidentally launching themselves into the sea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtxrp52PeDE "Video footage of Formula 1 driver Alberto Ascari in the monegasque sea"). For more Monaco Grand Prix-related information, the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix "Wikipedia page of the Monaco Grand Prix") is a good place to start.
