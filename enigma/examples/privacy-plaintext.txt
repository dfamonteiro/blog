Having privacy does not mean keeping everything secret; it means having the free‐
dom to choose which things to reveal to whom, what to make public, and what to
keep secret. The right to privacy is a decision right: it enables each person to decide
where they want to be on the spectrum between secrecy and transparency in each sit‐
uation. It is an important aspect of a person’s freedom and autonomy.
