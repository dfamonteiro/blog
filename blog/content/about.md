I'm a software engineer with a MSc in Informatics and Computer Engineering @[FEUP](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/en/WEB_PAGE.INICIAL "FEUP's webpage")
(Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto). I am currently working at [Critical Manufacturing](https://www.criticalmanufacturing.com/ "Critical Manufacturing home page").

I am currently interested in multithreaded programming, rocket control, orbital dynamics and in analysing mega constellations as distributed systems. As a fan of motorsport (F1, MotoGP, WEC, etc), I enjoy analysing certain aspects of those championships and imagining what the future of motorsport will look like, on a technical level.

In my spare time, besides writing code, I enjoy playing games such as [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/ "Kerbal Space Program's home page"),
[Factorio](https://www.factorio.com/ "Factorio's homepage") and blundering queens in chess. I'm also a mediocre trumpet player.

Feel free to reach out to me at daniel.amaro.monteiro@gmail.com or at [@dfamonteiro](https://twitter.com/dfamonteiro "My twitter profile") on twitter.
I am always happy to answer questions regarding my blog posts, projects, and employment opportunities.
