When it comes to historical races, the Monaco Grand Prix is definitely an odd one. Older than Formula 1 itself, it is F1's most glamorous and most prestigious race on the calendar, featuring a track layout that remains largely unchanged[^1] since the race's inception in 1929. Unfortunately, when it comes to on-track action, it is an absolutely dreadful race, with cars that are impossible to race on this track. So, when Formula E announced that the full track layout would be used for the 2021 Monaco E-Prix, people were hopeful that the premier electric series would provide a good race in this historical venue.

Well, it surely didn't disappoint: the 2021 Monaco E-prix was probably the best dry race Monaco had seen for over two decades, with a three-way battle for the lead between da Costa, Mitch Evans and Robin Frijns. Ant√≥nio Felix da Costa eventually won the race with a daring last-lap overtake on Mitch Evans. It was a moment of vindication for both Formula E and this legendary track.

This race was such a hit that the Monaco E-Prix became a permanent fixture of the FE calendar. The media reaction was also quite positive: [Inside Electric](https://inside-electric.com/)'s[^2] [Hazel Southwell](https://twitter.com/HSouthwellFE "Hazel's twitter profile") even suggested that Formula E should consider going to other legendary street circuits, such as Pau and Macau. I could definitely see a future where FE goes to Pau in every year that we don't go to Paris[^3]. Hosting a Formula E race in Macau's treacherous Guia circuit would be a lot trickier, however...

For more Monaco Grand Prix-related information, the [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monaco_Grand_Prix "Wikipedia page of the Monaco Grand Prix") is a good place to start.

## The Macau Grand Prix track layout

The Guia circuit is one of the most challenging race circuits on the planet. It combines an extremely twisty and technical section of road with an enormous 2 kilometer-long straight. Overtaking around this track is done pretty much exclusively on the straight with the aid of slipstream[^4].

This massive straight does pose a problem for Formula E's energy-constrained races: Are the Gen2 cars capable of enduring ~47 minutes[^5] of this track? Probably not. How about the Gen3 cars? They have a trick up their sleeves...

[^4]: Formula 3 cars have the luxury of DRS if they are within 1 second of the car ahead.

[^5]: This is just an educated guess of how long a 45 minutes + 1 lap race _actually_ is.

## The Gen3 recharging pit stop: a track designer's panacea

The [Gen3 Formula E car](https://motorsport.tech/formula-e/gen3-formula-es-big-step-into-unchartered-territory "Gen3 details and stats") represents an improvement on the Gen2 car on almost all areas:

|      Stats                 | Gen2           | Gen3             | Change |
|----------------------------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| Qualifying power output    | 250kw (335hp)  | 350kw (469hp)    | +40%   |
| Race power output          | 200kw (268hp)  | 300kw (402hp)    | +50%   |
| Battery weight             | 284kg          | 180kg            | -36.6% |
| Battery charge             | 54 kwh         | 51kwh            | -5.6%  |
| Regeneration (back/front)  | 250 (250/0) kW | 600 (350/250) kw | +140%  |
| Total weight (inc. driver) | 903kg          | 780kg            | -13.6% |

The one area that wasn't improved on was battery charge... or was it? Surprise, the Gen3 era will feature recharging pit stops! The Gen3 car will be able to come into the pits and stop for 30 seconds to recharge the battery at a rate of 600kw, putting 5kwh back into the battery. This is revolutionary because for every pit stop you add to a race, not only less time is spent racing (and consuming energy), but also more energy is added to the total available. Hopefully, this means that circuit designers won't need to add chicanes because they can simply add another pit stop.

## _How_ many pit stops would Macau need?
