When it comes to historical races, the Monaco Grand Prix is definitely an odd one. Older than Formula 1 itself, it is F1's most glamorous and most prestigious race on the calendar, featuring a track layout that remains largely unchanged[^1] since the race's inception in 1929. Unfortunately, when it comes to on-track action, it is an absolutely dreadful race, with cars that are impossible to race on this track. So, when Formula E announced that the full track layout would be used for the 2021 Monaco E-Prix, people were hopeful that the premier electric series would provide a good race in this historical venue. Well, it surely didn't disappoint: the 2021 Monaco E-prix was probably the best dry race Monaco had seen for over two decades, with a three-way battle for the lead between da Costa, Mitch Evans and Robin Frijns. Ant√≥nio Felix da Costa eventually won the race with a daring last-lap overtake on Mitch Evans. It was a moment of vindication for both Formula E and this legendary track.

This race was such a hit that the Monaco E-Prix became a permanent fixture of the FE calendar. The media reaction was also quite positive: [Inside Electric](https://inside-electric.com/)'s [Hazel Southwell](https://twitter.com/HSouthwellFE "Hazel's twitter profile") even suggested that Formula E should consider going to other legendary street circuits, such as Pau and Macau. I could definitely see a future where FE goes to Pau in every year that we don't go to Paris[^2]. Macau, however, would be a lot trickier. <!--Note: put image of track layout, highlight gigantic straight, Hazel Southwell twitter answer-->
