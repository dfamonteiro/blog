## The Good

The info is here!

## The Bad

The SQL queries aren't embedded in the trace file

## The Ugly

... But some awful-looking slices are included.

## The fix

You can get there with some trace file manipulation

## The End

It's disappointing that this SQL info isn't included out of the box, but at least we can take fate into our own hands and insert this information ourselves.
